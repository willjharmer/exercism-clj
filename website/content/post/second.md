In order to run the tests or use the code, you will need to install Leiningen v 2.6.1. To install and run the tests with lein, do the following:

#TODO: Complete how to run once you know how from travis
```bash
  git clone this repo
  install Leiningen
  run lein test and have it run recursively in all subfolders
```
